  W.E.T - Write every time 


  Convention - Best Practices 

OOP - 
  Object Oriented Programing
    - treat everything as an object

BOP 
  behavior oriented programing

inheritance - 
  Classes 
  relationships between objects

    everything the parent has the child also has
    access to

Encapsulation -
  bundling data all in a related place 

Polymorphism -
  objects can take many forms 
  classes 

Testing -
  check if the code works like its suppose to

  TDD - Test Driven Development
